# deeplearning_ultrasound_diagnosis
 In this project we use deep learning to train a model,  based on Ultrasound images, that helps in the diagnosis, 
 and management of chest opacities while overcoming the limitations of X-ray,
 and CT scan-based methods.


The folder for trial notebooks should not be used and was just code based on examples from tensorflow website in order to understand the workings of neural networks,
with special regard to image classification.
